Command line takes the argument that is the pid of the process using myint variable

logic:
    first take the input from the command using the variable myint variable
    
    inside the program using find_get_pid followed by  pid_task to find the corresponding task struct related to the process
    
    to get the process group id we use pid_vnr(task_pgrp(task))
    
    user id of a process is an attribute of task struct we print it using task->cred->uid
    
    for the command again it is an attribute of task struct we print it using task->comm
