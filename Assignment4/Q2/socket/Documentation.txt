C) Using the domain socket

Logic: For the server:
            1) remove an already existing server using remove()
            2) create a socket using socket(). 
                We will be using AF_UNIX socket to communicate between process on the same system.
                SOCK_STREAM to ensure TCP/IP protocol for the transfer of data, zero for no flags.

            3) prepare to bind(): it binds the socket to your system 

            4) listen(): wait for the request from the client

            5) accept(): accept the request sent by the client

            6) now recieve the fifty random strings such that first you recieve the string 
                followed by the number(indice) [done by using recv]

                send back the highest index usng send back to the client
            7) close the socket

        For the client:
            1) create the socket
            2) prepare for the connect(): to connect to the socket
            3) start the clock using clock_gettime()
            4) generate the random string
            5) send the data: first string and then indice
            6) then recieve the highest indice print it
            7) after all 50 strings have been send end the clock using clock_gettime()
